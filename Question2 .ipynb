    "I'm developing a ticketing system for a movie theater. The ticket prices are determined based on the age of the person and the time of the movie. The conditions for ticket pricing are as follows:\n",
    "If the person is under 12 years old, the ticket price is 50 Rupees.If the person is 12 years old or older, but under 18, the ticket price is 80 Rupees. If the person is 18 years old or older, and the movie is scheduled before 6 PM, the ticket price is 100 Rupees. If the person is 18 years old or older, and the movie is scheduled at or after 6 PM, the ticket price is 120 Rupees.\n",
